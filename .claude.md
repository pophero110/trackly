## Development Workflow Rules

### Git Commit Workflow
- **Always commit current changes first before adding more new changes**
  - When multiple features or fixes are being worked on, complete and commit the current changes before starting new work
  - This keeps the git history clean and makes it easier to track individual changes
  - Each commit should represent a complete, logical unit of work
