feat(frontend): Improve EntryDetailComponent auto-save reliability

Refactor auto-save mechanism in EntryDetailComponent to prevent data loss
and ensure UI consistency across different navigation scenarios.

This commit addresses the following issues:
- **Data loss on component unmount/re-render:** Previously, if EntryDetailComponent
  was unmounted or re-rendered with a different entryId before the debounced
  save fired, pending changes could be lost or incorrectly applied.
- **UI not updating after save:** Saves triggered by navigation were silent,
  preventing other UI components from reflecting the latest data.

Changes include:
- **Enhanced `debounce` utility:** Added `cancel()` and `flush()` methods to
  `packages/frontend/src/utils/helpers.ts` for better control over debounced calls.
- **Robust `EntryDetailComponent` auto-save:**
  - Implemented logic in `render()` to detect `entryId` changes, flush pending
    saves for the old entry, and cancel its debounce timer before re-rendering.
  - Updated `disconnectedCallback()`, `visibilityHandler()`, and `handleBeforeUnload()`
    to use `debouncedBackendSave.flush()` to ensure immediate execution of
    pending saves during component destruction or tab backgrounding.
  - Modified `saveToBackend` and `saveToBackendWithId` to accept a `silent` option.
  - Debounced auto-saves during typing are now explicitly `silent` to avoid UI flicker.
  - Auto-saves triggered by navigation or unload events are `non-silent` by default
    to ensure UI updates reflecting the saved data.
- **`Store.ts` `updateEntry` enhancement:** Modified to accept and propagate
  `silent` and `keepalive` options to `APIClient.updateEntry` for more
  flexible and reliable state management.

These changes collectively provide a more predictable and robust auto-save
experience, ensuring data integrity and correct UI presentation.
